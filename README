Surrogate deployment scripts.

build-release.sh executes all of the rebar commmands required to build a 
surrogate relase that is ready to be deployed.

To get surrogate running.

$ ./build-release.sh
$ ./release/surrogate/bin/surrogate console

Surrogate may need to run as root in order to bind privileged ports ( <1024).
